# Being paid for sitting at home!?

To clarify, the click-baity title doesn't mean for not doing anything. The *at home* part is the emphasis here. Even better, it could be any place you desire. You can travel around with what you earn and visit those places you've always dreamed about. Sounds impossible. But then freelancing happened.

It is interesting and started to gain a lot of traction, but then people started saying...

### Freelancing is scary!

We've all heard or read about stories how some clients can be evil and after all they put us through, the don't even pay. So instead of getting what you've worked hard for, you have to spend even more to fight for it. Or as in most cases, just let it go and wave your money goodbye. I started looking for agencies and similar middleman services for freelancers, but that wasn't looking any better. All this has discouraged me from looking forward to working as a freelancer. But then something great happened: a friend told me about [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/web).

### What is Toptal?

For freelancer, it's a way to work with variety of interesting clients while guaranteeing them to be paid for their work. And for the client, a way to hire the best freelancers out there, according to their data, only 3% of applicants are picked in their strict application process. Although this might seem scary, I for one believe it's a great move, since it's the only way to build a network of great freelancers.

I started to get interested and research further and I was amazed at the experiences people were sharing. And I've learned that I already read many of their great [blog posts](http://www.toptal.com/blog), mostly those related to JavaScript. My interest to apply was growing with each new thing I read. I was finally convinced how cool they really are when I've learned that they are supporting our local [Ruby meetups](http://www.meetup.com/RubySlovenia/events/227338174/). I say give me free burger and beer and I'm sold!
